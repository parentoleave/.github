# Parento

**Parento builds modern infrastructure for paid parental leave.**  
We make it possible for employers to offer equitable, compliant, and predictable paid parental leave—without turning HR, payroll, and finance into a stress test.

This GitHub organization contains the software systems that power Parento’s insurance products, leave management workflows, and parent experience programs.

## What We Do

Parento is a **Managing General Agent (MGA)** offering the first fully customizable **Paid Parental Leave Insurance** product in the market, paired with high-touch services and software that simplify one of the most complex benefits employers can offer.

At a high level, we help employers:

- Offer paid parental leave to **all full-time employees**, regardless of gender, family structure, or state
- Transfer financial risk away from the employer through insurance
- Coordinate leave across **state PFL programs, short-term disability, and employer payroll**
- Reduce HR burden with concierge support and automation
- Improve retention, return-to-work outcomes, and employee experience

## How Parento Works (Conceptually)

Parento operates at the intersection of **insurance, payroll, and leave management**:

- Employers maintain normal payroll during an employee’s leave
- Parento coordinates eligibility, claims, and offsets (e.g. STD, PFL)
- Approved claims are reimbursed to the employer by the carrier
- Employees receive uninterrupted pay and guided support throughout leave
- HR teams get a single, consistent process—across states and regulations

Parento itself does **not** make benefit determinations or pay claims directly. We manage policy operations, claims coordination, and product experience while working with licensed carriers, TPAs, and reinsurers.

## Why This Matters

The U.S. parental leave landscape is fragmented:

- No federal paid parental leave
- State programs vary widely in eligibility, duration, and pay
- Employers struggle to offer consistent, equitable policies
- Employees face confusing applications, paperwork, and pay gaps

Parento exists to make paid parental leave **boring in the best way possible**: predictable costs for employers, clear processes for HR, and real support for parents.

## Design Principles

Across our systems, we optimize for:

- **Equity by default** – one policy, one experience, all families
- **Human-first workflows** – software that supports real people in stressful moments
- **Operational clarity** – explicit ownership, traceable states, auditable data
- **Regulatory respect** – insurance, payroll, and compliance boundaries are non-negotiable
- **Pragmatism over novelty** – boring tech, clear contracts, fewer surprises

## About Parento

Parento was founded to support working parents through financial, emotional, and logistical challenges—before, during, and after leave. We believe paid parental leave should be equitable, scalable, and operationally sane.

Supporting parents shouldn’t be heroic.  
It should just work.
